1. What is the impact of varying batch sizes and why?

2. What is the impact of varying maximum epoch number?

3. What is happening with a large learning and what is happening with a small learning rate and why? What is the relationship between learning rates and batch sizes?

4. Implement a network that has in total around 10x more parameters than the toy network.

5. Test your implementation and evaluate its performance.
