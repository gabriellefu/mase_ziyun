# Lab 3

##1.Explore additional metrics that can serve as quality metrics for the search process. For example, you can consider metrics such as latency, model size, or the number of FLOPs (floating-point operations) involved in the model.

##2.Implement some of these additional metrics and attempt to combine them with the accuracy or loss quality metric. It's important to note that in this particular case, accuracy and loss actually serve as the same quality metric (do you know why?).
